# The Benefit POREfessional Pro Balm
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05478b56-37ce-4fe7-8e35-48ce57b3cba2.jpg)

Hello ! I just got my hands on benefit's porefessional pore balm . Its the number 1 selling product on benefit's counter so thought of trying. Firstly it is a tube and very convenient to use one can take out the quantity accordingly . Its very light in nature , feels like silk and has got little fragrance which is okay . Now this product is majorly for people who have a lot of pores on face . Luckily i do not have much of them so i just use it as a primer . It acts as a great base before foundation and gives a great look . It is a little expensive than other bases but personally i like benefit so would go for it again . From me its a 4.5 out of 5 product .
